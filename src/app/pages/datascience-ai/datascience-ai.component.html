                <h5>About Course</h5>
                <p>Data Science encompasses an interdisciplinary domain focused on extracting valuable insights and knowledge 
                    from data through the application of statistical and analytical techniques. On the other hand, Artificial 
                    Intelligence revolves around simulating human intelligence in machines, enabling them to autonomously perform 
                    tasks and make decisions.</p>
                <h6>What is Data Science?</h6>
                <p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines expertise from statistics, computer science, and domain 
                    knowledge to extract valuable insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It encompasses a range 
                    of techniques, including data cleaning, data preprocessing, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms. 
                    Data scientists play a pivotal role in understanding complex data patterns, making data-driven decisions, 
                    and predicting future trends.</p>
                <h6>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h6>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence, conversely, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. AI systems can 
                    learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, like 
                    speech recognition, natural language processing, 
                    and decision-making.</p>
                <h6>How are artificial intelligence and data science related?</h6>
                <p>Data science and artificial Intelligence are closely related as data science often incorporates AI techniques to 
                    analyze data and make predictions. AI, in turn, relies on data science to gather, preprocess, and interpret data 
                    for training its models.</p>
